- package require tclyaml

- tclyaml::get::channel <channel>

  Processes the yaml documents found in the open channel, starting at
  the current location in that channel.

  Result is a list of documents.
  A document is list of values.
  Values can be scalar, sequences or mappings
  Sequences and mappings are both lists of words.
  Their difference is in the intrepretation of words.
  Sequence = list
  Mapping = keys and associated values.
  Syntactically they are the same at Tcl level.

- tclyaml::get file <path>

  Convenience command around 'get channel' taking a path to a file to
  process. Otherwise identical.

- tclyaml::parse::channel <channel> <cmd> ?<arg>...?

  The low-level API to the parser. 

  Processes the yaml documents found in the open channel, starting at
  the current location in that channel.

  Generates a series of events describing the YAML, and invokes the
  specified command prefix (cmd ?arg...?) once per event. Arguments to
  the command prefix are:

  - event type    (string)
  - event details (dictionary)

  The arguments are provided in the order specified above.
  The presence of event details actually depends on the type.
  A number of events do not have any details, and are called only with
  the type.

  The contents of the event detail dictionary depend on the event type.

  Event types, and associated detail dictionary keys (if any):
