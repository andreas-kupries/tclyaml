# Welcome

Welcome to TclYAML, a binding to the C-based libyaml parser library
for [YAML Ain't Markup Language](http://yaml.org).

At our [home site](http://core.tcl-lang.org/akupries/tclyaml) you will
find the official [fossil](https://fossil-scm.org) repository used to
manage the sources, together with the bug tracker. This is also the
main location for releases to download from.

Two other locations for these sources are the

  - [ChiselApp Mirror](https://chiselapp.com/user/andreas_kupries/repository/tclyaml/index), and the
  - [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/andreas-kupries/tclyaml).
